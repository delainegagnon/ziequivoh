What are some bands that you don't particularly enjoy, but still like the guitarist? For me, I don't like Limp Bizkit mostly because I think Fred Durst is obnoxious in most of their songs, but I do like Wes Borland. I've found some instrumental versions of their songs that are pretty cool to play FPS games to.

Being in the fever of draft season has got me thinking: the best part about the draft is the hope (and somewhat naivete) that your team will improve. Until rookies step on the field week 1 everything is potential: every nice play in practice or preseason is a surefire guarantee that player is going to be a stud; every poor play is just an anomaly and the guy is young, don't worry he'll figure it out. So I thought it would be fun to put on our hindsight glasses to look back at past Niners draft.

I’m writing a program to output a certain amount of coins to give a customer. Everything compiles and runs fine with no errors or warnings in Borland C++. However, when i run the program it will output my initial message “get data” THEN i’ll put my data in THEN it’ll re output the “get data” message THEN i’ll have to put in my data again. it does this three times before outputting “Change Required” THEN. after this it SHOULD show how many coins i need. but instead it’ll output the first. I was asked by some people in a group to convert some C++ which was written and compiled with Watcom C++ and/or Visual C++ 4.10 although it works on Borland C++ 5.02 in my testing with linker issues.

I'm including everything from underlying ideas to languages and tooling to process to overall professional opportunities. My Take Pros Software engineering practices that promote maintainable software have gone mainstream: unit testing, recognizing principles like SOLID, using source control, etc. Some of this is facilitated by the next point. Tooling has improved immensely.

I know it's been talked about but it's crazy to think how in such a short period of time the 49ers went from having the roster with the most young talent to the rough state of the last three years. Aldon Smith was looking like a hall of famer the way he was piling up sacks. Kap looked every bit as good as any other young QB. Harbaugh was the hottest coach in football. Patrick Willis was a perennial pro bowler, bowman was lights out, and then Borland stepped in out of no where and looked great. # Join the server made for you and your playstyle!
